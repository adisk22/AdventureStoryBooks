# AdventureStoryBooks: *encouraging collaborative creativity in the classroom*

## Overview
AdventureStoryBooks is a web application that uses AI to help young users bring their stories to life. Designed with young learners aged 3 to 10 in mind, the platform aims to empower students to become creators rather than passive consumers of content.

## Motivation
In a world where AI is becoming increasingly prevalent, this project aims to introduce it to students as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for creativity. Few existing tools are designed specifically for younger learners, making this platform a unique opportunity to help them understand both the value of their own input and the potential of AI assistance.

## Next Steps for the Project
Students can join their respective classes and access multiple classes through the platform. They begin with a limited selection of story settings, or “biomes,” in which to create their stories. As teachers post educational goals and students complete them, they earn points that can be used to unlock new settings for future stories. In addition, students can view and collaborate on their classmates’ stories, fostering greater classroom engagement and creativity.
